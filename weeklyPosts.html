                I was able to start my hours as a Digital Library and Archives Intern for the Celtic Arts Foundation (CAF) just about two weeks before the Autumn 2021 quarter began.  Before week one, my supervisor and I went over the expectations and workload for the project.  The plan was that I would first evaluate the types of materials in the Robert Burns Dinner collection of CAF for whether they were present in both digital and physical format, whether they would have to be digitized of printed depending on what forms of the documents were manifested in the collection, and for the aboutness of the documents in the collection.  Upon scanning through the digital and physical holdings in week one, I was able to set up a spreadsheet for inventorying the entire Burns Dinner Collection.  Included in my spreadsheet were drop-down menus for the categories of material type and the categories requiring an answer to a yes/no or a present/absent question.  These were represented in dropdown menus as Y/N and P/A respectively and were designated as the columns that would assist me in evaluating which materials needed to be digitized or printed.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a first draft of the spreadsheet was created, I tested out my schema on the physical collection.  When about ten resources had been catalogged with the schema, I discovered that my draft material type categories could be refined.  For this part of the process, I took the material types I started out with and replaced vague or too specific terms with improved terms.  For this, I applied my archival knowledge gained from my part-time job at the Gates Archive to select common material types, and checked these against Library of Congress and Getty's Art and Architeture thesaurus, the latter being a resource that my workplace commonly relies on for description of archival items.  Using trusted thesauri in the field solidified my material type terms by week three. Additionally, I showed my spreadsheet to my supervisor to double check that I was on the right track.  She suggested that I add new columns to the spreadsheet regarding the digitization process, and I did so at her instruction.

                Weeks one and two were supplemented with research completed about the eventual online exhibition to be created using the Robert Burns Dinner collection and also the Highland Games collection.  In this research, I began compiling relevant resources to later present to my host institution.  These were saved in my University of Washington (UW) Google Drive and will be expanded upon throughout the quarter.  In total, I went onsite to CAF once during week one.

                Week two was comprised mostly of inventorying the physical resources in the Robert Burns Dinner Collection and of securing online remote access to the digital assets in the collection for myself.  In week two, I was able to go onsite two separate times and was able to complete the inventory of the Robert Burns Dinner Collection's physically-held items.  I ended my hours this week by starting to inventory the digital assets in earnest, which I was able to do both remotely and on-site.  In week two, I was also able to supplement my on-site time by assisting my supervisor with improving collection access to the library of CAF.  I did this by adding to the description of books already catalogged in the organization's digital asset management system (DAMS), which is AssetTiger.  This supplemental assignment has helped me begin evaluating the effectiveness of CAF's existing DAMS, which is one of my goals outlined in the Learning Outcomes Agreement for this project.

              At this point, there is still much inventorying that needs to be completed on the Robert Burns Dinner Collection, as the collection is more extensive than it appeared to be at the onset of this project.  By October 2nd, I was able to fully inventory all of the digital holdings from about 1991 to 2011 and must now complete the inventory of the digital assets for the records coveing the years 2012 through 2021.  I am still using my spreadsheet created in week one to continue this process and have inventoried a little over 280 physical and digital items total.  It is interesting to observe that, although I thought this part of the process (inventorying) could be completed fairly quickly, I still have a lot to go before I can consider the inventory of this collection complete.  Although this can be viewed as a setback, I have also found a lot of value in this unanticipated challenge.  This is the case because I have been able to further refine my material type categories with supproting evidence from Getty AAT and LOC Subject terms and plan on presenting my new list of terms to my supervisor when I see her tomorrow (Sunday, 10/3). When approved, I will update the drop-down menus in my spreadsheet to reflect the improvements made to my material type terms in my inventory spreadsheet. Because at the time of writing this, there is still about a day and a half left of week 3, I anticipate that other tasks that will round out my 15 hours for the week will include chipping away at more of the inventorying needing to be done on the digital collection.  Also, because I plan on going on-site to CAF tomorrow, I will be able to ask questions of my supervisor and of the CAF's institutional leadership to better plan for the digitization and printing phases of the DFW.
