                I was able to start my hours as a Digital Library and Archives Intern for the Celtic Arts Foundation (CAF) just about two weeks before the Autumn 2021 quarter began. Before week one, my supervisor and I went over the expectations and workload for the project. The plan was that I would first evaluate the types of materials in the Robert Burns Dinner collection of CAF for whether they were present in both digital and physical format, whether they would have to be digitized of printed depending on what forms of the documents were manifested in the collection, and for the aboutness of the documents in the collection. Upon scanning through the digital and physical holdings in week one, I was able to set up a spreadsheet for inventorying the entire Burns Dinner Collection. Included in my spreadsheet were drop-down menus for the categories of material type and the categories requiring an answer to a yes/no or a present/absent question. These were represented in dropdown menus as Y/N and P/A respectively and were designated as the columns that would assist me in evaluating which materials needed to be digitized or printed.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a first draft of the spreadsheet was created, I tested out my schema on the physical collection. When about ten resources had been catalogued with the schema, I discovered that my draft material type categories could be refined. For this part of the process, I took the material types I started out with and replaced vague or too specific terms with improved terms. For this, I applied my archival knowledge gained from my part-time job at the Gates Archive to select common material types and checked these against Library of Congress and Getty's Art and Architecture thesaurus, the latter being a resource that my workplace commonly relies on for description of archival items. Using trusted thesauri in the field solidified my material type terms by week three. Additionally, I showed my spreadsheet to my supervisor to double check that I was on the right track. She suggested that I add new columns to the spreadsheet regarding the digitization process, and I did so at her instruction.
              <p>
                Weeks one and two were supplemented with research completed about the eventual online exhibition to be created using the Robert Burns Dinner collection and the Highland Games collection. In this research, I began compiling relevant resources to later present to my host institution. These were saved in my University of Washington (UW) Google Drive and will be expanded upon throughout the quarter. In total, I went onsite to CAF once during week one.

                Week two was comprised mostly of inventorying the physical resources in the Robert Burns Dinner Collection and of securing online remote access to the digital assets in the collection for myself. In week two, I was able to go onsite two separate times and was able to complete the inventory of the Robert Burns Dinner Collection's physically held items. I ended my hours this week by starting to inventory the digital assets in earnest, which I was able to do both remotely and on-site. In week two, I was also able to supplement my on-site time by assisting my supervisor with improving collection access to the library of CAF. I did this by adding to the description of books already catalogued in the organization's digital asset management system (DAMS), which is AssetTiger. This supplemental assignment has helped me begin evaluating the effectiveness of CAF's existing DAMS, which is one of my goals outlined in the Learning Outcomes Agreement for this project.

              At this point, there is still much inventorying that needs to be completed on the Robert Burns Dinner Collection, as the collection is more extensive than it appeared to be at the onset of this project. By October 2nd, I was able to fully inventory all the digital holdings from about 1991 to 2011 and must now complete the inventory of the digital assets for the records covering the years 2012 through 2021. I am still using my spreadsheet created in week one to continue this process and have inventoried a little over 280 physical and digital items total. It is interesting to observe that, although I thought this part of the process (inventorying) could be completed quickly, I still have a lot to go before I can consider the inventory of this collection complete. Although this can be viewed as a setback, I have also found a lot of value in this unanticipated challenge. This is the case because I have been able to further refine my material type categories with supporting evidence from Getty AAT and LOC Subject terms and plan on presenting my new list of terms to my supervisor when I see her tomorrow (Sunday, 10/3). When approved, I will update the drop-down menus in my spreadsheet to reflect the improvements made to my material type terms in my inventory spreadsheet. Because at the time of writing this, there is still about a day and a half left of week 3, I anticipate that other tasks that will round out my 15 hours for the week will include chipping away at more of the inventorying needing to be done on the digital collection. Also, because I plan on going on-site to CAF tomorrow, I will be able to ask questions of my supervisor and of the CAF's institutional leadership to better plan for the digitization and printing phases of the DFW.

              <em>Week 3 update:</em> I was able to ask a lot of questions of my supervisor and feel like I know much better what my path forward looks like.  We added in some deliverables to my <a href="CoreyC_CAF_Agreement(NEW).pdf" aria-label="Read more about my learning outcomes agreement here" class="accordion-links" target="blank">Learning Outcomes Agreement</a>, including researching accessibility guidelines for the web, a manual on procedures and processes for future MLIS students who work with CAF, etc.  In week three, I also finished inventorying all of the items for the Robert Burns collection and started creating two spreadsheets: one of items needing to be printed and one of items needing to be printed for the physical collection.

            For week four (10/04/2021-10/10/2021) differed from week three, in that week three was composed of almost 19 hours of work, while I was able to get less time in this week. I am still adjusting to the in-person instruction, so making this new transition has made other aspects of my life more difficult. That said, I was able to complete a major accomplishment for the DFW this week! I have finally completed my list/compilation of assets that need to be printed and assets that need to be digitized. I have planned to visit CAF this coming Wednesday (10/13/2021), where I will begin my digitization and printing work. Before going to the physical location of CAF, I will prepare the collection of digital documents to print so I can spend most of my time doing the digitization, which I anticipate may take more time and energy. This task was started as a part of my hours for week four and will continue into week 5 and should be completed before Wednesday the 13th of October.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, week four's hours have been composed of research on Accessibility best practices in archives and on the web, accessibility for digitized items, how to start a metadata schema for a brand-new archive, and on procedures and practices to include in my manual for future MLIS students to use at CAF. This manual was started as a Microsoft OneNote file, so I would have the capability of composing chapters and sections of chapters.  I'm hoping this will make information easier to find for future students. I will continue adding to this manual as the quarter progresses.

                  Week 5 (October 11-17) was a very productive week in terms of new steps forward on the project. I started the week preparing to print the documents in my inventory list that met two requirements: 1.) the organization specified they wanted physical records of certain types, such as financial records, event programs, etc. 2.) The item was not in my inventory list for the current physical assets in this archive. I was able to complete printing all of documents meeting these requirements from 2001 through 2010. Next Wednesday, I will resume printing the remaining documents needing to be printed for the years 2011 through 2021. I was also able to create a system for giving printed items unique identification numbers. I recorded this workflow in my OneNote for Policies and Procedures for the CAF Archive. Additionally, I started recording steps for the CAF Archive metadata schema in the OneNote, created a chapter structure for various sections of the policies and procedures manual, and added other relevant details about CAF workflows and made these procedural decisions based on research I cited in the OneNote and based on my own experience working for an archive. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also found a platform that CAF can use for free up to 5GB that will allow them to display their archival holdings online for the public. The software, Preservica, also allows the organization to keep any assets private that they wish to keep private. Throughout the week, I experimented with Preservica for the purposes of evaluation for suitability for the CAF Archive and determined I should propose this software solution to my supervisors at CAF. I am extremely happy to report that this software meets their organization's needs and that we will be using Preservica to show the community the rich history of the organization. On the same day that this was decided, Sunday (10/17/2021), the organization received a new piece of technology that will make scanning projects much more straight-forward. The machine is called a Fujitsu ScanSnap, and my DFW supervisor, Elena, and I were able to test it out on a delicate music book. We found that the scanner produces clear images of scanned content and can correct scanned images and to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This will be an immensely effective resource for ensuring accessibility of CAF's collections for the public.

                  <ol>
                    <li> I was able to scan and digitize every physical item in the Robert Burns Collection </li>
                    <li> I started assigning unique catalog numbers to each uploaded scan </li>
                    <li> I started separating the files by topic (based on our new controlled vocabulary whose primary authority source is the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus)</li>
                    <li> I prepared to provide OCR for every scanned PDF from the physical collections</li>
                    <li> Non-OCR PDFs in the digital collections were also sorted and prepared to obtain OCR capabilities</li>
                  </ol>
                  In a previous post, I noted that the ScanSnap should have direct to OCR abilities, and it does. However, it has not yet succeeded at making CAF's collection items have OCR, so I discussed this blocker with my internship coordinator, and we decided that using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (a software I already had on my computer) would be our best current option while we figure out how to make the new scanner scan items directly with OCR. The OCR capabilities would be added to all PDFs in CAF's collection the following week.

                  Week 7: This week was a successful week for completion of tasks that I had been preparing and planning for a few weeks. I found quick and efficient ways to: give CAF's PDFs OCR readability in bulk and upload all collection items to Preservica in an already-organized folder structure I had been putting together for many weeks. Now that all items are uploaded to Preservica with their unique catalog numbers as placeholder titles, my next task is to add metadata to all uploaded collection items using the information I have already recorded about each item in my inventory list. I have also already simplified this process by connecting each inventory item to a unique catalog number, which should make this task go more smoothly. However, looking back at my inventory sheet, the scope and content notes that I have for most of the born-digital items are comparatively less substantive, and therefore less helpful for finding the content later. So, throughout this process, I hope to expand the scope and content notes for the born-digital items.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An important concept that I learned this week was that, when you put most of your time into planning and creating a structure for an archive, the time it takes later in the process to organize everything goes much quicker. I am also having so much fun working with this organization and the amazing people who are responsible for CAF's many years of success. Non-profits are awesome!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I should also note here that I have all collection items separated into a few specific content types: (1) Born-digital documents, (2) Digitized documents (3) Physical documents, including printed versions of relevant documents that were not yet in CAF's physical collection. All these facets have been noted in my unique catalog numbering system as letters: DF for "Digital File," D for "Digitized," and F for "file (physical)" respectively. I have chosen these alphabetic indicators to begin each resource's catalog number and have explained this in the Policies and Procedures manual I am writing for future archivists working with CAF. This practice was based on cataloging experience from my job as an archive intern elsewhere.

                    Week 8 was composed of continuing the cataloging needing to be completed on the uploaded assets in Preservica and additional research for the Policies and procedures manual I am putting together. The cataloging is self-explanatory, as I am slowly adding Dublin Core metadata for each item that has been uploaded to Preservica. While cataloging, I am quality control (QC) checking to see that 1.) each asset has been properly uploaded and 2.) the OCR for PDF documents is in full working order. The quality control opportunity while cataloging has proven extremely valuable in ensuring that CAF gets the best completed product possible.

                  <p>
                    Additionally, the research completed in week 8 has been recorded in my Google Drive and will become a part of my Policies and Procedures manual, mostly for the sections pertaining to the controlled vocabularies, metadata schema, and the taxonomy built for this archive. Because I am still new to a lot of these topics, I have felt that more research was needed to fill my gaps in understanding. This research and the cataloging project will both continue into week 9.

                      Overall, this week was composed of a very productive and helpful meeting with Elena on 11/14/2021 over Zoom, work on the Policies and Procedures Manual, adding metadata to many more assets uploaded to Preservica, and taking the steps necessary for my GitHub site to serve as the reference I will give CAF by the end of the quarter. Here, I am planning to upload resources that I believe should be accessible for them to make my web page the first go-to handbook for all things CAF archives. I thought that this would be the best way to make my research accessible and usable, as I have put a lot of work into making sure I’m recording my workflows, processes, etc. A lot of the documents still need to be uploaded to GitHub for these purposes, but I am putting a hold on that until 1.) I am certain that all documents are in a well-prepared final draft and 2.) I can add more navigation tabs to my web site to create a better information architecture that will be intuitive for current and future users (please send me any feedback, by the way!). Because I ended up using a ready-made platform, Preservica, to curate exhibits online for CAF, I wanted to channel the web accessibility requirements of this DFW into my website to provide a friendly, helpful user experience that will make archiving for CAF very straight-forward after I move on from this position.
                      Additionally, I was working on the Policies & Procedures Manual for CAF’s archive, when I tried to share the document with Elena and discovered that the OneNote, I had made was not shareable, since UW's subscription to Microsoft 365 does not allow me to share the OneNote with people outside of UW. I discussed this blocker with Elena in our meeting, and we decided to migrate the OneNote manual I have been working on into a Google Document. Towards the close of the quarter, I will turn this shared Google Doc into a PDF after Elena reviews it and I will publish this document on my website for this project, which should allow it to be accessed easily in the future. This document will be searchable as well, which should make everything super easy to find within the manual. I will also ensure that a copy of this manual is saved in the CAF’s data storage cloud, which is accessible in Mount Vernon, WA.

                      Another important benchmark completed this week was that I added metadata to all the assets in the <a href="https://t99cc02d9e0abe541.starter1ua.preservica.com/uncategorized/SO_57acb75d-6181-40e3-a5d0-528a24467de4/" aria-label="link to the speeches (documents page) for CAF on Preservica" target="blank" class="accordion-links">“speeches (documents)” </a> in our Preservica profile. Granted, I finished some other sections as well, but this seemed like more of an accomplishment, as the CAF has expressed much interest in making these documents and the event programs accessible. Also, in Preservica, I was able to ask some questions on their “Support” page and in their community forum. I am very happy to say that I always get quick responses to my questions, so I am not left in the dark for long. One of my mentors at Gates Archive taught me that, when you are choosing a DAMS or similar system for management of digital assets, looking to see if there is a solid community surrounding that software in which you can engage, ask questions, and make suggestions. Preservica passes this test for my evaluation of them for CAF.

                      I should add here that Elena taught me about a super amazing resource that I need to be aware of, moving forward in my career. When we discussed Preservica’s accessibility, Elena informed me about something called a VPAT, which is an “Accessibility Review of Universal Access” (Preservica, 2018). In our meeting, Elena located a pdf of Preservica’s VPAT online and shared this with me. This is one example of some documentation that I think will be valuable to put on my website for CAF.
